# DL_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_Using_CNN

## 📌 Project Overview

Facial Expression Recognition is a deep learning–based computer vision project that aims to automatically identify human emotions from facial images. This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify facial expressions into multiple emotion categories such as angry, happy, sad, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of facial images and learns important facial features using convolutional layers.
